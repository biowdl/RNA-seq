  # The gruesome bash command injection using sed is needed
  # as cromwell does not handle relative outputs well.
  # It will put them relative to each execution folder.
  # Therefore the output needs be an absolute path. We can
  # accomplish this by injecting $PWD (equal to whatever absolute
  # dir our test is running) into the inputs.json
  # It is a gruesome hack, but it works.
