These are fastq files for a test sample.

The _umi files were generated by removing the `/1` and `/2/ suffixes of the headers and running umi-tools:
`umi_tools extract --stdin R1.fq.gz --read2-in R2.fq.gz --bc-pattern "NNXNN" --stdout R1_umi.fq.gz --read2-out R2_umi.fq.gz`
using the umi-tools container:
`quay.io/biocontainers/mulled-v2-509311a44630c01d9cb7d2ac5727725f51ea43af:6089936aca6219b5bb5f54210ac5eb456c7503f2-0`.
The UMIs in these files aren't actual UMIs, but just the first few bases of the reads. This is good enough for testing.
